    "🔄 **Streaming Modes**\n",
    "\n",
    "FastRTC supports three streaming modes, depending on your application's needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `send-receive`: Enables full bidirectional communication. This is the mode we’ll use, ideal for conversational agents.\n",
    "* `send`: Streams data from client to server only.\n",
    "* `receive`: Streams data from server to client only.\n",
    "\n",
    "🎙️ **Modalities**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can build your application around one of three modalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `video`: For real-time video streaming.\n",
    "* `audio`: For real-time audio — this is our focus, since we’re building phone-call-style agents.\n",
    "* `audio-video`: Combines both streams for full audiovisual experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **Handlers**\n",
    "\n",
    "The handler is the core intelligence behind your `Stream` — it's where you define how incoming data should be processed. For audio streams, you'll typically implement a class that inherits from either `StreamHandler` or `AsyncStreamHandler`, depending on whether your processing logic is synchronous or asynchronous.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastRTC also offers a convenient built-in option: the `ReplyOnPause` handler. This handler uses **voice activity detection (VAD)** to determine when the user has finished speaking, and only then sends the collected audio to your generator function. We’ll be using this approach in some of our examples to simplify interaction and improve responsiveness."
